            To God be the glory, great things he has done! <br>
            So loved he the world that he gave us his Son, <br>
            who yielded his life an atonement for sin, <br>
            and opened the life-gate that all may go in.

            Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord, <br>
            Let the earth hear his voice! <br>
            Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! <br>
            Let the people rejoice! <br>
            O come to the Father through Jesus the Son <br>
            and give him the glory, great things he has done!

        <p class="pt-2">
            Oh, perfect redemption, the purchase of blood, <br>
            To every believer the promise of God; <br>
            The vilest offender who truly believes, <br>
            That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

            Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! <br>
            Let the people rejoice! <br>

        <p class="pt-2">
            Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done, <br>
            And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son; <br>
            But purer, and higher, and greater will be <br>
            Our wonder, our transport when Jesus we see.
